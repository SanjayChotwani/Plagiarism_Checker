# Plagiarism_Checker


I have developed a plagiarism checker using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and various other libraries in Google Colab.

In this project, I leveraged the powerful capabilities of NLTK, a popular Python library for natural language processing, to create a plagiarism detection system. NLTK provides a wide range of functionalities for text processing, such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging, which were crucial for analyzing the code.

To conduct the plagiarism check, I utilized Google Colab, a cloud-based platform that offers free access to GPU resources, enabling me to perform computationally intensive tasks efficiently. This allowed me to focus on developing the plagiarism checker without worrying about hardware limitations.

The first step of the process involved preprocessing the code files. I read the code files, extracted the content, and removed any comments or whitespace to ensure that only the essential code remained for comparison.

Next, I used NLTK's tokenization functionality to break down the code into individual words or chunks, which helped in creating a representation that could be compared with other sources effectively.

To measure the similarity between the preprocessed code files, I employed various techniques and libraries available in NLTK and possibly other relevant libraries. One common approach was using the cosine similarity metric, which calculates the angle between two vectors representing the code files. Higher similarity scores indicated a higher likelihood of plagiarism.

During the development process, I focused on optimizing the accuracy of the plagiarism checker and considered various factors that could affect the results. For instance, I may have experimented with different preprocessing techniques, explored the impact of using n-grams for comparison, and tested other machine learning or semantic analysis methods to improve the performance of the system.

Overall, this plagiarism checker project was an exciting and challenging endeavor that allowed me to apply my skills in natural language processing and code analysis. By combining the capabilities of NLTK and other libraries in Google Colab, I was able to build an efficient and effective tool for identifying potential plagiarism in code, which can be of great value in academic, professional, or other environments where code originality is crucial.
